# Exploit Templates

The idea behind the exploit skeletons is to have a starting point for both remote and local exploits in each language.  This should help expedite exploit conversion between the 
languages and also provide a basic starting point for exploit development. Its intent is replace intial Googling.

As these evolve I hope to add buffer sizing and building mechanisms so you can plug in return address, offset, and space and be good to go.
